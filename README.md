# My story...

## I'm a software tester. 👨‍💻

Although I'm not a very good programmer I'm someone who can get things done, with the help of Googling aimed at great communities like StackOverflow, GitHub, etc. Aren't we all, after all? 😉 But I genuinely like to code. I look for every opportunity to continuously  learn, improve until I can call myself a software engineer in testing. 

I like to work in UNIX/ Linux 🐧 environments. Even in my personal laptop I use Fedora 🕴️ now. My favorite IDE for Java ☕ is definitely IntelliJ IDEA and for JavaScript Visual Studio Code with One Dark 🌆 theme on both. 

I implement page object model design pattern in all test automation projects. I can handle TestNG or JUnit, Maven or Gradle and I'm confident that I can create automation framework from scratch to the point where it runs on Jenkins via Git repository. 

I'm comfortable in Java more than any. But I can manage JavaScript too, when it comes to Cypress 🌲 for example. Not a big fan of Gherkin-Cucumber 🥒 to be honest.

Selenium is reliable like a Toyota but Cypress is like a luxurious European car. Nowadays I'm playing with Playwright 🎭 with Java which feels great too.

This GitHub account is my playground for all thee reasons above. Hope someone struggling will benefit from them as well for educational purposes.

### Enjoy and use responsibly. ✌️

TLDR:
* Selenium + Java + TestNG + Maven
* Cypress + Javascript + Cucumber
* Playwright + Java + TestNG + Maven
